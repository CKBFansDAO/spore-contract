# Spore Contracts

This repo contains the contract of Spore and Cluster, also the definition of molecule types, utilities.

## Quick Start

Build contracts:

``` sh
capsule build
```

Run tests:

``` sh
capsule test
```


## Deployed Code Hashes
The versioning philosophy is **"Using code_hash as version"** while developing with Spore Protocol.

A different code hash means a different version of Spore Protocol.

Make sure you are using the proper version you want, because there's no such "upgrade/downgrade" method to use, the only way to achieve this in a similiar result is destroy and reconstruct a new Spore with same fields. 

Here are lists of Spore protocol contract cells code_hashes (Top item is the latest, bottom item is the oldest):
