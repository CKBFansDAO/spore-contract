# <p align="center">üß¨ Spore Protocol</p>
<p align="center">
  A protocol for valuing on-chain contents, build on top of <a href="https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb">CKB</a>. Check <a href="https://docs.spore.pro">Spore Docs</a> for a quick start.
</p>


Spore developers are supposed to use [Spore SDK](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-sdk) instead of this project directly. But if you want to test/extend the contract or deploy on a local chain, you can follow the [Development](#‚öôÔ∏è-development) part.

## About

Spore is an on-chain protocol to power digital asset ownership, distribution, and value capture. For more, check out https://spore.pro

This repo contains the [Spore RFC](./docs/RFC.md), [Spore Mutant RFC](./docs/MUTANT.md), [Spore Cluster Proxy/Agent RFC](./docs/RFC_PROXY_AGENT.md), protocol types [schema definition](./lib/types/schemas/spore.mol) and [implementation](./contracts/) of Spore contracts written in Rust.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Development
Before development, basic dependencies are required:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross)
- [Capsule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/capsule)

To build contracts, please run one of below commands:

```bash
$ capsule build # build in debug mode
$ capsule build --release # build in release mode for testnet
$ capsule build --release -- --features release_export # build in release mode for mainnet
```

To check native test cases, which are placed in [tests](./tests/), please run:

```bash
$ capsule test # test in debug mode
$ capsule test --release # test in release mode
```

### Writing extra contracts

If your development requires to be built on Spore, steps below are recommended:

1. Writing a new Type contract
2. Modify existed contracts

For method 1, the flow is:

1. Run `capsule new-contract YOUR_CONTRACT_NAME` to initialize a new contract project
2. Modify `Cargo.toml` of your contract, and introduce `spore-types`,`spore-utils`, `spore-constant`
3. Implementing your contract rules in `entry.rs`
4. Writing new tests in `tests/src/tests.rs`. See existed test cases for how-to

## Deployed Code Hashes
The versioning philosophy is **"Using code_hash as version"** for Spore Protocol, which means the different code hash matches the different version.

Make sure you are using the proper version you want, because there's no such an "upgrade/downgrade" method but we suggest to use "destroy/reconstruct" method instead, which requires no modification of any fields in Spore cell.

Our `forzen` versions of contract, which are our prior versions, can be found in [directory](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-contract/tree/master/deployment/frozen) `./deployment/frozen`. To describe more clearly, the `frozen` information contains each avaliable `code_hash` generated from Spore contracts with corresponding commit hash for the rolling back help.

`./deployment/migration` recorded the deployment detail for each Spore contract. Here's a list about the newest versions:

#### Spore
Pudge Testnet:
- data_hash: `0xfd2dc714c4d4cb81e8621e5c124465a048d06551b467f58eaa64041dd322cf81`

#### Cluster
Pudge Testnet:
- data_hash: `0x372b7c11d7b688e02d9c2b7604fbdf0dc898a0f6741854ea6c65d41f8ef4a64e`

#### Cluster Proxy
Pudge Testnet:
- data_hash: `0xfc1fbe95e7fb5be520f1adb2bdbd1529422613b02254ff01fd0f30604861ae36`

#### Cluster Agent
- data_hash: `0xa170fc93235213e90214e4273bb283e7979bf6477f70b4f2319d3777ec36235c`

#### Mutant (Lua Extension)
Pudge Testnet:
- data_hash: `0x94a9b875911ace20f1f0d063a26495d14e4b04e32fd218261bb747f34e71ae47`

In addition, using Mutant contract requires the binary of Lua library. Information are recorded [here](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-contract/tree/master/contracts/spore_extension_lua/lua). For simplicity, it's already deployed in the Pudge Testnet:

#### Spore Lua Lib
- tx_hash: `0x8fb7170a58d631250dabd0f323a833f4ad2cfdd0189f45497e62beb8409e7a0c`
- index: `0`
- data_hash: `0xed08faee8c29b7a7c29bd9d495b4b93cc207bd70ca93f7b356f39c677e7ab0fc`

## Deployment

We provided a simple bash script to operate deployment through `ckb-cli` toolchain, details refer to [here](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-contract/tree/master/deployment)
